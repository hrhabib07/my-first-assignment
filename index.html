                    <p>Chard, like other green leafy vegetables, has highly nutritious leaves, making it a popular
                        component of healthy diets.Chard has been used in cooking for centuries, but because it is the
                        same species as beets, and similar to vegetables such as cardoon, the common names that cooks
                        beet, perpetual spinach, beet spinach, seakale beet, or leaf beet it is the

                    <h2>Grits</h2>
                    <p>There are two basic preparation of savory grits—creamy or cheesy—and four basic varieties of
                        grits—traditional stone-ground, quick-cooking, instant, and hominy. While the base ingredient
                        is the same in all of these varieties of grits, the way in which they’re processed is
                        differen. Traditional stone-ground coarse grits take between
                        30-60 minutes to cook. The key to getting smooth, creamy grits rather than lumpy grits is to
                        them cook low and slow. </p>

                    <h2>Curried Chicken</h2>
                    <p>There’s nothing groundbreaking about how this chicken curry is made. The one key step is to fry
                        off the curry powder. This brightens up the flavour of the spices creates more golden bits on
                        the base of the pan, and both of these things add more flavour into the curry sauce!These are
                        the curry powders I currently have in my pantry – but I’ve used plenty of other brands in the
                        past. Curry powder is used in all sorts of recipes, not just Indian curries.</p>
